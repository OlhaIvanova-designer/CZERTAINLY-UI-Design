 Update Associated RA Profiles widget - changed title to Associations, also Removed the Status column, added Resource and Object columns. 
Rules & Groups widget was split into two views - Selected and Available - to improve clarity and usability.A tabbed layout was implemented for both views, grouped by resource type (e.g., Certificates, Keys) to avoid mixing resources and reduce cognitive load. In Rule & Group Detail Display I chose to use a popup/modal instead of a collapsible row - this decision was made due to limited table space and the need to display detailed information in a clearer, more focused way.
