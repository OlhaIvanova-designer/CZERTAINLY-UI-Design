title: "Related Certificates Tab"
description: >
  Removed Source Certificate UUID from the Other Properties widget. Added a new Tab for Related Sertificates to display related and source certificates in separate tables. The Source Certificates table includes a delete action to remove the source certificate association.
It also includes an add action, which opens a pop-up with a certificate selection table, implemented in the same way as the “Push to Location” functionality from the Location detail page.
